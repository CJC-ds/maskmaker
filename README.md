# MaskMaker

## About

When conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) put the condition on the mask (y), we needed some way of generating
masks for a project.

## Future work

* Add methods to manipulate generated or existing masks
through geometric translation, rotation and resizing of polygons.

* Method to save the image mask to disk.
